# Dijsktra-3D
The aim of this project is to simulate a very important algorithm of computational geometry, Dijkstra algorithm.
The problem statement is as follows - 
Given is a cube of a particular size  (taken as input from the user). There are unit cubes within the bigger cube which have random refractive indices(weight). Given a source (taken as input from the user), find the shortest path a light ray will have to travel from the source to any destination in the given cube using Dijsktra algorithm. Simulate the 3D figure. 
Things to be kept in mind - 
The source can be coordinates of any of vertex of any of the unit cubes. 
The weight of an edge is the average of indices of cubes it falls into.
Weight of a path is the length of it multiplied with the weight of cube/edge.
